# AUTOMOTIVE-PARAMETER-MONITORING-SYSTEM-USING-CAN
This project simulates a real-time vehicle monitoring system where multiple embedded nodes communicate over CAN bus to display important vehicle parameters such as:  
* 🌡️ Engine Temperature 
* ⛽ Fuel Level 
* 🔄 Turn Indicators (Left / Right)

# Project Overview

This project is designed using three independent CAN nodes:

## > Node	Function
* Main Node	Central controller + LCD dashboard
* Fuel Node	Reads fuel sensor and transmits data
* Indicator Node	Controls left/right indicators

The nodes communicate through the CAN bus using the MCP2551 CAN transceiver.

# Parameters Monitored
## > Engine Temperature
* Measured using DS18B20 digital temperature sensor
* Uses 1-Wire communication protocol
* Displayed continuously on LCD
## > Fuel Level
* Read through ADC
* Converted into percentage (0–100%)
* Transmitted from Fuel Node via CAN
## > Turn Indicators
* Left and Right indicators controlled through switches
* Indicator Node performs LED blinking operations

# System Architecture
## The project follows a distributed CAN-based architecture.

* Main Node (Master Controller)
  * Reads temperature sensor
  * Receives fuel data from Fuel Node
  * Sends indicator commands
  * Updates LCD dashboard
* Fuel Node
  * Reads analog fuel sensor
  * Converts ADC value into percentage
  * Sends data over CAN bus
* Indicator Node
  * Receives commands through CAN
  * Controls left/right indicator LEDs
