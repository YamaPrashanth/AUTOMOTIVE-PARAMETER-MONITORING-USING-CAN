# AUTOMOTIVE-PARAMETER-MONITORING-SYSTEM-USING-CAN
This project simulates a real-time vehicle monitoring system where multiple embedded nodes communicate over CAN bus to display important vehicle parameters such as:  
* 🌡️ Engine Temperature 
* ⛽ Fuel Level 
* 🔄 Turn Indicators (Left / Right)

# Project Overview

This project is designed using three independent CAN nodes:

## Node	Function
* Main Node	Central controller + LCD dashboard
* Fuel Node	Reads fuel sensor and transmits data
* Indicator Node	Controls left/right indicators

The nodes communicate through the CAN bus using the MCP2551 CAN transceiver.

# Parameters Monitored
## Engine Temperature
* Measured using DS18B20 digital temperature sensor
* Uses 1-Wire communication protocol
* Displayed continuously on LCD
## Fuel Level
* Read through ADC
* Converted into percentage (0–100%)
* Transmitted from Fuel Node via CAN
## Turn Indicators
* Left and Right indicators controlled through switches
* Indicator Node performs LED blinking operations

# System Architecture
## The project follows a distributed CAN-based architecture.

* Main Node (Master Controller)
** Reads temperature sensor
** Receives fuel data from Fuel Node
Sends indicator commands
