# AUTOMOTIVE-PARAMETER-MONITORING-USING-CAN
This project demonstrates a real-time automotive parameter monitoring using the CAN (Controller Area Network) protocol, where multiple embedded nodes communicate efficiently to monitor and display critical vehicle information. The system is designed using LPC2129 ARM7 microcontrollers with inbuilt CAN support, enabling reliable and high-speed data exchange between different vehicle modules.

The monitoring system continuously acquires and displays important vehicle parameters such as:

* Engine Temperature Monitoring
* Fuel Level Detection
* Turn Indicator Status (Left / Right)

Each parameter is handled by dedicated nodes connected through the CAN bus, ensuring modular design, reduced wiring complexity, and efficient communication. The received data is displayed on an LCD dashboard in real time, simulating an intelligent vehicle monitoring and dashboard system used in modern automobiles.

This project highlights the practical implementation of embedded systems, CAN-based communication, sensor interfacing, and real-time automotive monitoring applications.

# Project Overview

This project is designed using three independent CAN nodes:

## > Node	Function
* Main Node	Central controller + LCD dashboard
* Fuel Node	Reads fuel sensor and transmits data
* Indicator Node	Controls left/right indicators

The nodes communicate through the CAN bus using the MCP2551 CAN transceiver.

# Parameters Monitored
## > Engine Temperature
* Measured using DS18B20 digital temperature sensor
* Uses 1-Wire communication protocol
* Displayed continuously on LCD
## > Fuel Level
* Read through ADC
* Converted into percentage (0–100%)
* Transmitted from Fuel Node via CAN
## > Turn Indicators
* Left and Right indicators controlled through switches
* Indicator Node performs LED blinking operations

# System Architecture
## The project follows a distributed CAN-based architecture.
